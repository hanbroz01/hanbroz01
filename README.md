My goal is to secure a <b>Praktikum (internship)</b> where I can apply what I’m learning, grow through real-world projects,
and build a strong foundation for a junior developer role.
</p>

<p style="margin-top: 20px;">
<b>➡️ Available for an unpaid internship from 10 August 2026 to 2 April 2027 ⬅️</b>
